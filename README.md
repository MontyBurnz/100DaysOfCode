# 100DaysOfCode
## Day 1 ##
7th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Had a cold shower (Yes, its relevant :laughing:)
* Created this repo for the challenge.
* Learned how to use markup to format my README page. 
* Created a new README page for my main profile with my fresh skills!
### Thoughts ###
~~Dayumm that water was COLDDDDD!! :cold_face:~~

I did get a little nervous about starting a challenge right before the bootcamp (which happens to be touted as the hardest thing well ever do!) but I then realised it's complimentary to the camp and it's only 1 hour a day. Now I've got stuck in and I'm already enjoying it!

## Day 2 ##
8th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* I decided to try out some javascript (complete noob!) and follow along with some javascript app building tutorials. First step was building a colour flipper app using html, css & javascript.
* Started using VS code and downloaded 'Live preview' extension to see what I was building.

## Thoughts: ##
I think I may have jumped the gun on this one! :sweat_smile: Perhaps I should have tried to learn some basic Javascript before attemtping to build an app with it? I was able to follow along with the tutorial around 60-70% and then explored the creators github to help me finish it off. I did enjoy starting to use VS code and I'm already starting to build a better picture of how everything works together.

Note to self: LEARN JAVASCRIPT!

## Day 3 ##
9th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Resumed 'Responsive Web Design' course at freecodecamp. 
* Started to get familiar with variables in CSS by building a city skyline image.
* Cloned the repo for this journal using Git Bash & started updating it with VS code instead of completing it all on the website.

### Thoughts: ###
I'm not sure if im friends with CSS :sweat_smile:. Maybe its just the way we have to type everything manually on freecodecamp but it just seems unnecessarily cumbersome styling this way. I will continue to practice it until its second nature nevertheless! 

Also thought it was a good idea to start using git bash and vscode to complete this journal and make commits so that by the time I start SoC bootcamp, I know my way around a little bit :smile:.

UPDATE: Man I had a little drama with GIT Bash just now. Had to have a little refresher on how to use it. Glad I decided to start having a bash (no pun intended) with it before monday! Through my searching I also realised VS code has GIT built in too (I think). Will try that next.

## Day 4 ##
10th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Continued with the CSS variables project on FreeCodeCamp.
* Watched coding related video's on youtube to see other peoples experiences & what they'd do differently.

### Thoughts: ###
Super busy day today but just managed to get 1hr of CSS & additional 30-45 minutes worth of youtube videos in (its now 11:15pm). I'm now almost 2/3rd's of the way through the 'Responsive Web Design' course & can't wait to get onto the javascript course after this one. Watching other people's experiences and the things they'd do differently is definitely a big help!

## Day 5 ##
11th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Completed CSS skyline project on FCC

### Thoughts: ###
Another busy day today but I managed to complete the CSS project on FCC. It did get a little complex at times but I'm amazed at how it turned out. There was a moment when I had to delete the `border:` property and when it dissapeared and the whole picture came together it was beautiful :astonished:! I did start to get frustrated at one of the variables not working properly but after some time and the odd swear word I realised I'd missed a `,` from one of the lines. I'm starting to develop an eye for detail thats for sure!

## Day 6 ##
12th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Started taking a look into JS and watching videos on peoples experiences learning it from scratch.
* Took a look at the curiculum for SoC (Starts tomorrow!)

### Thoughts: ###
This looks like its going to be a lot more difficult than html & css! :sweat_smile: I decided to take a little look into it as my SoC journey starts tomorrow and I've not reached the JS course on FCC yet. I did watch some videos on youtube to get guidance form others that have studied it and to learn from what they would do differently. I unfortunately had to cut the day short due to a severe migraine and I decided to have an early night for the big day tomorrow.

## Day 7 ##
13th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Started my SoC Bootcamp journey!!
* Continued with more JS for beginners.
* Downloaded and used 'Live Server' extension with VS code to preview code real time.

### Thoughts: ###
Today was the first day of my bootcamp jounrey and the first time in a very long time in a full-time study environment. I really enjoyed the first day but it did get a little taxing on the brain past early afternoon. Im definitely ready for a good sleep :laughing:. I also watched and followed along with another JS intro/tutorial on youtube. One thing I have noticed though is I prefer the FCC style of learning much more than following along on youtube. 

I've also just noticed its the end of my first week on this challenge! I might have to take it a little easier for a few days while I get adjusted to the bootcamp and organise my other daily acitivities better. I will definitely try to keep things much more project & building focused from now on. Will also try to get as much FCC work done as I can and upload those projects to github too. Roll on another week of the challenge!

## Day 8 ##
14th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Today we were split into a group of 3 and got to do plenty of work together. We'd previously learned about the importance of pair programming and it was really starting to show now. Each of us had slightly different abilities and combined together I think it went really well!
* We built upon yesterdays knowledge of problem solving and incorporated computational thinking (Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition & Algorithm) and then we got to use this knowledge in our teams to complete various tasks.
* We also completed a grid puzzle (similar to boggle) and were tasked with creating a process that would help solve similar future puzzles using pattern recognition. This got us all working together really hard and showed us the importance of understanding a problem and creating simple steps to solve it (pseudocode).
* I also started JS basics on FCC as we start covering JS in the bootcamp tomorrow and I wanted a little prep.

### Thoughts: ###
Another really good day at the bootcamp & I'm realising the importance of teamwork for sure! Something Chris said really resonated with us after the challenges. It was a quote that he said was often attributed to Einstein > “If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.” Once we started on the puzzle task this became painfully apparent. It took us much longer to understand the problem than it did to actually solve it! All the pieces of the problem solving puzzle have started to come together now and I feel I know how to work much more effectively after just 2 days of bootcamp. 

After SoC I tried my hand at a little JS on FCC as I much prefer learning this way. I have started to see similiarities between JS and CSS which Is a good thing! I wanted to get a little bit of knowledge as we start covering JS tomorrow in the bootcamp. Its been a super long day so thats it from me! Logging off at 10pm :sleepy:

## Day 9 ##
15th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Today we started learning JS with Chris & covered:

  - Programming basics / 5 pillars of programming (data types, variables, conditions, functions, and loops)
  - Data types in JS 
  
* I got to play around with the console on chrome a bit more to practice JS live.
* We built a password checker programme for a webpage that reveals hidden secret data. The password is input via a `prompt` and 3 attempts are given.

### Thoughts: ###
Another intense day of learning but we managed to get the ball rolling in our trio quite quickly. We do need to learn to read instruction properly first as we were so eager to get the work done we didn't realise the workshop for the password checker came with a guide. We ended up making one from scratch using what we had learned throughout the day. It wasnt the same but it worked and we were proud we did it without outside help!

## Day 10 ##
16th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* This morning we learned about the importance of feedback with Joseph Holden. We covered many aspects of what it takes to make successful teams and the importance of productive feedback. 

* After the morning session it was back to JS and today we covered objects and arrays. My key learning points from the day were:
  - In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any JavaScript data type.
  - Objects (even if they're empty) are not the same.
  - Properties in JavaScript objects can be accessed using dot notation (e.g. `obj.propertyName`) or bracket notation (e.g. `obj['propertyName']`).
  - Objects and arrays in JavaScript are mutable, meaning that you can add, delete, or modify properties after the object has been created.
  - Object property names can be any string, including spaces, special characters, and reserved keywords, but it is generally recommended to use camelCase for readability.
  - An array in JavaScript is a collection of values (list), which can be of any data type, including other arrays.
  - Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element of an array has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.
  - Arrays have a length property, which indicates the number of elements in the array.
  - Elements in an array can be accessed using bracket notation (e.g. `myArray[0]`) or with methods like pop(), push(), shift(), and unshift()
  
  ### Thoughts: ###
  I really enjoyed the morning session about giving and recieving feedback and it reminded me why the School of Code is so much more than just a standard coding course. We got a lot more time working on objects & arrays in the workshop and I'm started to get used to working together in a small team. This evening a few of us planned a little revision session on zoom but we ended up just chatting away for a while. It was fun though! 😆
