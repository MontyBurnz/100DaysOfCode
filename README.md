# 100DaysOfCode
## Day 1 ##
7th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Had a cold shower (Yes, its relevant :laughing:)
* Created this repo for the challenge.
* Learned how to use markup to format my README page. 
* Created a new README page for my main profile with my fresh skills!
### Thoughts ###
~~Dayumm that water was COLDDDDD!! :cold_face:~~

I did get a little nervous about starting a challenge right before the bootcamp (which happens to be touted as the hardest thing well ever do!) but I then realised it's complimentary to the camp and it's only 1 hour a day. Now I've got stuck in and I'm already enjoying it!

## Day 2 ##
8th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* I decided to try out some javascript (complete noob!) and follow along with some javascript app building tutorials. First step was building a colour flipper app using html, css & javascript.
* Started using VS code and downloaded 'Live preview' extension to see what I was building.

## Thoughts: ##
I think I may have jumped the gun on this one! :sweat_smile: Perhaps I should have tried to learn some basic Javascript before attemtping to build an app with it? I was able to follow along with the tutorial around 60-70% and then explored the creators github to help me finish it off. I did enjoy starting to use VS code and I'm already starting to build a better picture of how everything works together.

Note to self: LEARN JAVASCRIPT!

## Day 3 ##
9th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Resumed 'Responsive Web Design' course at freecodecamp. 
* Started to get familiar with variables in CSS by building a city skyline image.
* Cloned the repo for this journal using Git Bash & started updating it with VS code instead of completing it all on the website.

### Thoughts: ###
I'm not sure if im friends with CSS :sweat_smile:. Maybe its just the way we have to type everything manually on freecodecamp but it just seems unnecessarily cumbersome styling this way. I will continue to practice it until its second nature nevertheless! 

Also thought it was a good idea to start using git bash and vscode to complete this journal and make commits so that by the time I start SoC bootcamp, I know my way around a little bit :smile:.

UPDATE: Man I had a little drama with GIT Bash just now. Had to have a little refresher on how to use it. Glad I decided to start having a bash (no pun intended) with it before monday! Through my searching I also realised VS code has GIT built in too (I think). Will try that next.

## Day 4 ##
10th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Continued with the CSS variables project on FreeCodeCamp.
* Watched coding related video's on youtube to see other peoples experiences & what they'd do differently.

### Thoughts: ###
Super busy day today but just managed to get 1hr of CSS & additional 30-45 minutes worth of youtube videos in (its now 11:15pm). I'm now almost 2/3rd's of the way through the 'Responsive Web Design' course & can't wait to get onto the javascript course after this one. Watching other people's experiences and the things they'd do differently is definitely a big help!

## Day 5 ##
11th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Completed CSS skyline project on FCC

### Thoughts: ###
Another busy day today but I managed to complete the CSS project on FCC. It did get a little complex at times but I'm amazed at how it turned out. There was a moment when I had to delete the `border:` property and when it dissapeared and the whole picture came together it was beautiful :astonished:! I did start to get frustrated at one of the variables not working properly but after some time and the odd swear word I realised I'd missed a `,` from one of the lines. I'm starting to develop an eye for detail thats for sure!

## Day 6 ##
12th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Started taking a look into JS and watching videos on peoples experiences learning it from scratch.
* Took a look at the curiculum for SoC (Starts tomorrow!)

### Thoughts: ###
This looks like its going to be a lot more difficult than html & css! :sweat_smile: I decided to take a little look into it as my SoC journey starts tomorrow and I've not reached the JS course on FCC yet. I did watch some videos on youtube to get guidance form others that have studied it and to learn from what they would do differently. I unfortunately had to cut the day short due to a severe migraine and I decided to have an early night for the big day tomorrow.

## Day 7 ##
13th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Started my SoC Bootcamp journey!!
* Continued with more JS for beginners.
* Downloaded and used 'Live Server' extension with VS code to preview code real time.

### Thoughts: ###
Today was the first day of my bootcamp jounrey and the first time in a very long time in a full-time study environment. I really enjoyed the first day but it did get a little taxing on the brain past early afternoon. Im definitely ready for a good sleep :laughing:. I also watched and followed along with another JS intro/tutorial on youtube. One thing I have noticed though is I prefer the FCC style of learning much more than following along on youtube. 

I've also just noticed its the end of my first week on this challenge! I might have to take it a little easier for a few days while I get adjusted to the bootcamp and organise my other daily acitivities better. I will definitely try to keep things much more project & building focused from now on. Will also try to get as much FCC work done as I can and upload those projects to github too. Roll on another week of the challenge!

## Day 8 ##
14th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Today we were split into a group of 3 and got to do plenty of work together. We'd previously learned about the importance of pair programming and it was really starting to show now. Each of us had slightly different abilities and combined together I think it went really well!
* We built upon yesterdays knowledge of problem solving and incorporated computational thinking (Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition & Algorithm) and then we got to use this knowledge in our teams to complete various tasks.
* We also completed a grid puzzle (similar to boggle) and were tasked with creating a process that would help solve similar future puzzles using pattern recognition. This got us all working together really hard and showed us the importance of understanding a problem and creating simple steps to solve it (pseudocode).
* I also started JS basics on FCC as we start covering JS in the bootcamp tomorrow and I wanted a little prep.

### Thoughts: ###
Another really good day at the bootcamp & I'm realising the importance of teamwork for sure! Something Chris said really resonated with us after the challenges. It was a quote that he said was often attributed to Einstein > “If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.” Once we started on the puzzle task this became painfully apparent. It took us much longer to understand the problem than it did to actually solve it! All the pieces of the problem solving puzzle have started to come together now and I feel I know how to work much more effectively after just 2 days of bootcamp. 

After SoC I tried my hand at a little JS on FCC as I much prefer learning this way. I have started to see similiarities between JS and CSS which Is a good thing! I wanted to get a little bit of knowledge as we start covering JS tomorrow in the bootcamp. Its been a super long day so thats it from me! Logging off at 10pm :sleepy:

## Day 9 ##
15th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Today we started learning JS with Chris & covered:

  - Programming basics / 5 pillars of programming (data types, variables, conditions, functions, and loops)
  - Data types in JS 
  
* I got to play around with the console on chrome a bit more to practice JS live.
* We built a password checker programme for a webpage that reveals hidden secret data. The password is input via a `prompt` and 3 attempts are given.

### Thoughts: ###
Another intense day of learning but we managed to get the ball rolling in our trio quite quickly. We do need to learn to read instruction properly first as we were so eager to get the work done we didn't realise the workshop for the password checker came with a guide. We ended up making one from scratch using what we had learned throughout the day. It wasnt the same but it worked and we were proud we did it without outside help!

## Day 10 ##
16th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* This morning we learned about the importance of feedback with Joseph Holden. We covered many aspects of what it takes to make successful teams and the importance of productive feedback. 

* After the morning session it was back to JS and today we covered objects and arrays. My key learning points from the day were:
  - In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any JavaScript data type.
  - Objects (even if they're empty) are not the same.
  - Properties in JavaScript objects can be accessed using dot notation (e.g. `obj.propertyName`) or bracket notation (e.g. `obj['propertyName']`).
  - Objects and arrays in JavaScript are mutable, meaning that you can add, delete, or modify properties after the object has been created.
  - Object property names can be any string, including spaces, special characters, and reserved keywords, but it is generally recommended to use camelCase for readability.
  - An array in JavaScript is a collection of values (list), which can be of any data type, including other arrays.
  - Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element of an array has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.
  - Arrays have a length property, which indicates the number of elements in the array.
  - Elements in an array can be accessed using bracket notation (e.g. `myArray[0]`) or with methods like pop(), push(), shift(), and unshift()
  
  ### Thoughts: ###
  I really enjoyed the morning session about giving and recieving feedback and it reminded me why the School of Code is so much more than just a standard coding course. We got a lot more time working on objects & arrays in the workshop and I'm started to get used to working together in a small team. This evening a few of us planned a little revision session on zoom but we ended up just chatting away for a while. It was fun though! 😆
  
  ## Day 11 ##
17th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Today was our first SoC hackathon! We had to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
* This was a full days task and we had to link in everything we'd learned in the last couple of days!
* We learned about one of the inbuilt objects in JS and used it to generate a random number `Math.random()`

### Thoughts: ###
We decided to break down all of the steps required to build the game (just like Chris taught us) and then got to it. We found it quite difficult to begin with but once we started it started to flow much better. There was a few points in the day where we were stuck and had to ask for help but what else could we expect after learning JS for 2 days?

 ## Day 12 ##
18th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Today I continued with the JS course on FCC
* I also recapped some of the work we did last week on the bootcamp

### Thoughts: ###
FCC is really helping me cement what I've learned during the week so I'm starting to get a little more confident. I went over some of the workshop's we were working on just to see how I would go about things if I had to do them again. It's been an intense week so im taking it a little easier over the weekend and thats fine :rofl:.

 ## Day 13 ##
19th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Still working away at the FCC JS course
* learned more about accessing/modifying Objects in JS
* I also wrote up a few days worth of journal entries today for this challenge as I've had barely any time since thursday.

### Thoughts: ###
I need to get much more efficent with time management as im starting to realise just how much time and effort its going to take to make the most out of this bootcamp! I've managed to catch up on the last 3 days worth of journal entries but I need to upload pictures of my work still. All in all, its been a pretty productive week thats for sure!

## Day 14 ##
20th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* This morning we had our first team feedback session with our programming partners
* We introduced ourselves to our new teams
* Had an introduction to CodeWars and in our teams tried to solve some basic kyu 8 problems.

* We then went onto learn about the DOM & worked on our repo's solo. My key learning points were;
  - JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM, allowing developers to dynamically create, modify, and delete HTML elements and their attributes, styles, and content
  - The DOM tree consists of a hierarchy of nodes, which represent different parts of the document, including elements, text nodes, and attributes.
  - How to create & select elements eg. `document.querySelector` & `document.createElement`.
  - Assigning variables to elements and adding text 
  - Appending children to parent elements 
  
  ### Thoughts: ###
  I found the feedback session great this morning and it genuinely felt like we were all here to help each other! Gonna miss the old trio but we must move on. I felt like I was a little slower today after the weekend and there was definitely a lot to take in. My new team were great & both keeping me on my toes with their speed. I also had my first mentor meeting today and it was nice speaking to someone who'd already been through the same experience. Zaid (my mentor) gave me a challenge tot ake forward into next week and i'm looking forward to completing it.

  ## Day 15 ##
21st March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Completed some more CodeWars tasks in our team e.g creating a function to output the opposite number of the input (1 becomes -1).
* Had a super interesting talk with a former SoC alumni 
* Started learning about and using event listeners for buttons, clicks, data inputs etc.
* Then the rest of the day we were tasked with using Ai (ChatGPT & Git Co-Pilot) to create code and make it work. My key learning points were;
  - Breaking down the steps not only helps us but makes the code created by the Ai so much better!
  - learned various new methods and properties eg. `getElementById` & `.innerHtml`
  - I also learned about a JS function that can be used directly in html called `onclick`
  - Always go through Ai code to make sure everything is right & that you fully understand it to help debug future problems.
  
  ### Thoughts: ###
  It was so good to hear from the former bootcamper and her experiences both in the camp and in the real world as a developer. She talked about 'Imposter Syndrome' and that she still (even as a developer) sometimes uses google to recall how to use certain code. This was just what the DR ordered as a lot of us were starting to think we needed to learn all of this straight away :sweat_smile:. I also found the AI afternoon workshop super cool as we got to use tools to help us code much more efficiently and also to understand how the code was being used. We created a rock paper scissors game and chatGPT only needed 17 lines of JS which was remarkable considering how many lines we all used in last weeks hackathon :rofl:.

## Day 16 ##
22nd March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Today we started to learn about synchronous & asynchronous functions. My key learning points were;

  Synchronous functions:

  - Execute code in a blocking manner, meaning that they wait for a task to complete before moving on to the next one.
  - Can cause the user interface to freeze if they take too long to execute.
  - Are easier to reason about because they execute code in a predictable order.
  - Are traditionally used for simple tasks that don't require much time to complete.
  
  Asynchronous functions:

  - Execute code in a non-blocking manner, meaning that they don't wait for a task to complete before moving on to the next one.
  - Can run in the background while other code executes, which keeps the user interface responsive.
  - Use callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax to handle the results of the asynchronous task.
  - Are traditionally used for tasks that involve network requests, file I/O, or other time-consuming operations.
  
  * We also learned about the `setTimeout` & `setInterval` methods and incorporated them within our functions.
  * In the afternoon we covered API's and how to use the `fetch` method to access data from them and how to parse data from a JSON file.
  * We then had a bash with async functions and fetching data from API's. We also covered the 3 states of a promise (resolved, pending & rejected).
  
### Thoughts: ###
It was interesting to learn how a webpage escapes the usual top down order with an async function and things are starting to come together in my head. Still finding it a little hard to cope with the volume of new info but the more I practice the easier it gets!

## Day 17 ##
23rd March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* This morning we had another mindset session and covered 'Cognitive Diversity' and the Myers-Briggs model. This was a super interesting morning and we covered different ways that we could use to help understand each other and different ways of thinking.
* We also had another guest speaker come in who was a UI/UX pro (Pavaan) and he taught us about his line of work and the tools we will go on to use when dealing with UI/UX.
* In the afternoon our team got paired with another team and the 6 of us were given a research topic. This task was all about research and presentation. We broke our topic down and researched key points and came together to present it all in a 4 minute video. 

### Thoughts: ###
I really enjoyed both the guest speakers today! This is definitely what makes SoC such a great bootcamp. The research and presentation task at the end was super fun but a little nerve wracking for me too as im not the best at public speaking. It all went down well and aside from a little screenshare related issue, im super happy with how it turned out!

## Day 18 ##
24th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

**Friday Hackathon day!!**

* Today we bought together everything we learned this week about async functions & API's and made our first webpage.
* Our team chose to make a page that generates dad jokes and then lists the previous joke history.
* We also had to present our page and code to the rest of the group at the end of the day.

### Thoughts: ###
This was a really enjoyable task and we got to implement everything we learned so far. Everything from planning, HTML, CSS, JS and even presentation skills were tested to the limit! We had a great plan and with some more time I think the site could have been brilliant 😄. We added as much humour as we could and and emergency stop button that popped up with an alert which said 'calling mum' once clicked 😆. The CSS during the last few hours of the day was the most frustrating part and it's made me realise I need to get better at it. 

All in all, what a wonderful week! Gonna miss working with the team, they helped me out a lot for sure.

## Day 19 ##
25th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Today (on a **saturday**) I decided to complete the recap tasks we were given by the SoC.
* The task included bits of everything we'd learned in the week including;
  - Asynchronous functions and `for` loops
  - Objects and arrays
  - `setInterval` & `clearInterval` method
  - API's, `Fetch` & JSON files.
  - Creating and appending to a list using JS

### Thoughts: ###
We were given the option of either completing these tasks between 9-11am on a monday (late start) or completing them over the weekend. All im saying is i spent a lot more than 2 hours! 😢 5 hours in I was wondering what was wrong with a piece of my code. After all that time, I realised I hadnt called the function and wanted to cry. Maybe it was my brain in a fasted state? (Ramadan) At least I know im never making that mistake again 😆

## Day 20 ##
27th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Guest Speaker (alumni) of SoC talking about his role as an SRE.
* New teams and feedback for the previous weeks team.
* Learned abouit Agile methodology and its principles vs the old 'Waterfall' method. Some of my key learning points were;
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Individuals and interaction over process and tools
  - Responding to change over following a structured plan
  - Prototyping/working solutions over comprehensive documentation
  
  * In the afternoon we started to take a look at UI/UX and the differences between them. UI is about the look and feel of a product, while UX is about how the product     works and how it makes the user feel.
  * After the course I had a little bash at making a simple to-do list as it was a task i was given by my SoC mentor. 
  
### Thoughts: ###
As we've moved onto a new topic (UI/UX) there wasn't much coding done today and it was mainly classroom based but with regular team discussions. My brain needed a     little rest and it gave me time to catch up on a basic to-do list (mentor project) and some other things I was working on. 
  
### Link(s) to work / Resources: ### 
  
12 principles of agile.

## Day 21 ##
28th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Today we started off with a team codewars session and I got to have a bash at `str.split("")`, `str.reverse()` & `str.join("")`. I learned that `("")` after the `str.split` method splits the string into seperate letters and puts them into an array.
* We then went back to UI/UX for the rest of the day and covered;
  - The five stages of the design process. Emphatise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.
  - Paper protoyping 
  - Disney's creator strategy (The dreamer, The realist & The critic)
  - User centred design (Technically feasible, Economically viable & Desirable for the user)
* We got to cover all of the above in great detail within our teams as we had to plan, design and test an idea for a bootcamp application process.

### Thoughts: ###
Today's focus was on planning and design, which offered a refreshing change from the intensive coding sessions we've had for the past two weeks. This highlights why School of Code stands out from the typical bootcamp experience. By starting from the very beginning, we gained valuable experience in project design, and it all came together when we began to design our application process. I learned that despite our assumptions of being similar to the end-user, it's easy to overlook basic elements that would otherwise seem obvious. This is where early-stage feedback and testing play a crucial role.

## Day 22 ##
29th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* We continued with UI/UX and were tasked with creating a bootcamp of our own choosing.
* We had to think about all the reasons we wanted to join SoC and our thought process and our feelings/emotions throguhout the application.
* We decided to chose a crypto education focused bootcamp.
* We broke everything down, created user stories & personas and came up with ideas as a dreamer, realist and critic.
* Also had a little bash at paper prototyping again.

### Thoughts: ###

Another day of trying to bring out my more creative side, what could possibly go wrong? :rofl: Jokes aside, I really enjoyed today and learning about how my teamates felt throughout their application process. We had a little bash at each others scratch games (:shushing_face: dont tell anyone) and discussed the various feelings/emotions we went through throughout the application process. Overall it was good to learn how to map out a full suer journey using our own journeys to emphatise with our target audience. 


## Day 23 ##
30th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* This morning we covered different aspects of UI such as Visual vs Human 
* We also got to experiment with various tools and website such as;
  - Coolors
  - Adobe Colour Picker
  - Canva Photo Color Matcher
  - Lighthouse
  - Invision Free Hand
  - Figma 
  * We used lighthouse to check various websites and compare their performance and discussed how to improve perforance such as accesibility.
  * I also got to learn more about CSS variables, why/when we should use them,  & CSS specficity.
  * Today was also mindset day and we discussed positional behaviour & the various types of listener and how to improve our listening skills.
  * We also had some guest speakers in for a talk about UI/UX roles and how to get into that type of work.
  
### Thoughts: ###
  
Aside from learning about lots of different tools including lighthouse (which I found super interesing), I reallyyyyyy enjoyed the talk with the guys from Nester! It was so nice to have Alex & Javaid talk about their experiences in the field and how to stand out and get jobs.

## Day 24 ##
31st March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Hackathon friday!!!
* Today we used everything we learned in the week to create our bootcamp
* We had to create the HTML and CSS as well as all the planning stages and prototyping
* Key objectives completed;
  - Created a plan of action & flow diagram
  - Created user persona and story
  - Created figma prototype
  - Attempted to put it all together into a working site
  - Used various tools such as coolors & lighthouse through the building of the site.
  - Presentation on our work
  
### Thoughts: ###
  
Wow! Super busy day today So many different tools to try and experiment with and so little time. We got off to a pretty good start with the planning and user journey side of things and moved onto the figma prototype. We had a few differences in the design initially but we gelled together and gave it 100% after a vote. We went straight for the high fidelity designs and tried to use the code from figma in our css file. This is where the trouble began :smiling_face_with_tear:. We ran into problems due to screen sizing (one team mate had a super wide screen) and we got stuck trying to make the css look even remotely similar to our HiFi design. The problem was that the code being exported from figma was using px and not percentages but we managed to correct most of it in the end. 

We ended the day with presentations and im getting so much better at them! Some of the teams made some super proffesional looking pages, its crazy how fast were moving!

## Day 25 ##
3rd April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
#### Testing Week ####

* Today started of with feedback for the Previous weeks teams and the joining of new teams.
* We had guest speakers in from talis talking about testing .
* We started learning about and using node.js which is a runtime environment for JS.
* We also learned about splitting JS into smaller seperate files.
* Learned how to install and run unit test's with Jest.

### Thoughts: ###
More new tools and programmes to get my head around :sweat_smile:. The talk with Nadeem from talis was absolutely brilliant! Such a knowledgable person and taught us a lot about qualities we should have as developers alongside the importance of testing software. A lot of new things to learn today but it went really well! I've come to the conclusion that I dont need to know everything 100% and as long as I can confidentally use the doc's and resources to be able to do what I need to, I'm on the right track :smile:.


## Day 25 ##
4th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Started of this morning with another codewars session
* Learned more about the types of testing e.g. Unit testing & Integration testing
* Created test.js files and made skeleton tests
* Completed testing classroom workshops for the rest of the day

### Thoughts: ###
Although all of this is new to me, I feel slightly more confident with this as its new to everyone! When learning JS it's been clear that many off the cohort are already very experienced in it and although I try not to compare myself to them it can get hard sometimes. Now that we're all pretty much on the same boat, I can see it's not just me who finds it harder initially :sweat_smile:.

## Day 26 ##
5th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Today we spent the day covering playwright and we covered;
  - Basics of integration testing
  - Introduction to playwright
  - Playwright documentation for installation
  - Playwright documentation on writing and running tests.
  - Built in locators & their retry-ability
  * I also had my mentor meeting in the evening.


### Thoughts: ###
Things were starting to get a little muddled up today having just covered Jest yesterday and now having slightly different syntax for Playwright but we managed pretty well. Im starting to get faster at navigating the docs and finding out all the information I need to quite quickly. I also had my mentor meeting today and aside from our general chatter we went over my To-do list app together and highlighted areas for improvment.

## Day 27 ##
6th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Early morning Codewars
* Thursdays mindset talk about our inner critic vs inner champion (brilliant as usual)
* Presentation in small teams about our favourite topic so far (2.5 minutes)
* We also had guest speakers in from Linkedin talking about how to create our profiles and stand out
* Hackathon!! We had to do a short early hackathon due to the long weekend (Bank Holiday).

### Thoughts: ###
Super interesting talks today as usual with both Jo and the guys from Linkedin. I really need to make a profile and start making connections as I now realise how useful it is. If only I had a half decent picture :rofl:. The hackathon and codewars went really well today. We we're one team member down and the two of us are on pretty similar levels when it comes to coding so we worked really well together and tried to break things down and understand them. There was a lot to fit in today due to the long weekend and we've been given recap tasks over the weekend to make up for time off.

## Day 28 ##
8th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Completed some recap tasks from SoC.
* Made a simple kata (codewars) and wrote the test functions for it using Jest.
* Did some more catching up on Playwright.
* Brief introduction to React

### Thoughts: ###
I completely forgot how to make some steps while trying to install Jest and make the tests work and it got a little frustrating. I spoke to a fellow student and realised a lot of us were having the same issue but it was finally resolved. I made my simple kata and all the tests for it and carried on with the recap tasks. The weather is really good this weekend and i've been indoors for far too long so im taking some time to relax and step away from the keyboard too!

## Day 28 ##
11th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Today we started learning about React JS. My key learning points were; 
  - React JS is a library used for building user interfaces (UIs) for websites
  - It is based on the idea of breaking down UIs into small, reusable components
  - React uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance by only updating the parts of the UI that have changed
  - Can be used for server-side rendering, which improves website speed and search engine optimization (SEO)
  - React is declarative, which means developers describe what they want to happen and React handles the underlying updates
  - Has a large and active community, with many resources available to help developers learn and use it
  - Used by many large companies, such as Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, and Instagram
  - Class components Vs functional componenets (old vs new style)
  
* We also covered JSX which is a extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files to create UI components in React. Under the hood, JSX is transformed into regular JavaScript code before it's executed in the browser.

### Thoughts: ###
I was super excited to start learning about react as I heard it made life as a developer so much easier! I've wanted to make my own websites as a side project too so I couldn't wait! I quickly realised the learnign curve is going to be steep with this one. I can see it does make things so much easier but i can foresee many evenings and weekends are going to get spent trying to get my head around it all :sweat_smile:.

## Day 29 ##
12th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

* Started off the morning with codewars
* Researched what the `reduce()` function is in javascript - It is used to take an array of values and "reduce" it down to a single value, by performing a specified operation on each item in the array. This can be useful for performing calculations, filtering or transforming data, or otherwise manipulating arrays of data used in your code.
* We started learning about `useState` In React, the useState hook is a built-in function that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value, and a function to update that value. You can use this hook to define and update state variables that determine what's displayed in the UI of your React application. Whenever a state value changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state.

* We then went on to learn more about Hooks in React. My key learning points were;

  - Created In 2018
  - Hooks are a way to use state and other React features in functional components.
  - Commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef.
  - Hooks can only be used in functional components, not class components.
  - Hooks are composable and can be combined to create more complex functionality.
  - They can improve code readability and reusability.
  - Need to be imported into components e.g. `import { useState } from "react";`

## Day 29 ##
13th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Mindset day with Joe about team decision making
* We had to talk about designing a car buying app in our new teams and what features it would have.
* The main part of the tasks was team work and decision making and we learned about different ways to vote including;
  - Dot voting
  - Roman Voting
  - Brain trust 
  
* We then went back to learning React in the afternoon and we covered;
  - Immutability - In React, immutability means not directly changing the state or props of a component, but instead creating new copies of them when making updates.
  - The spread operator `[...]` - 
  - `.map` & `.filter`
  
### Thoughts: ###
It was nice to have Joe come back in to break up what has been an absolutely jam packed week! We had monday off due to bank holiday so trying to learn React in such  a short space of time has been proving difficult for sure. The lack of calories and sleep from fasting (Ramadan) doesnt help :sweat_smile:. Gonna keep on practicing and I know with time it'll all come together.

## Day 30 ##
14th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###

Hackathon friday!!!

* Today we had to build a To-Do List app using the react we learned during the week.
* We used figma to create a high fidelity wireframe 
* We attempted to style it with css but didnt have much time left by the end of the day.
* We also had to present it at the end of the day in true SoC style.

### Thoughts: ###
It was a super hard challenege considering we only started reacted on Tuesday but with a lot of documentation and the use of additonal resources we managed to pull it off! Very pleased with how it turned out.

### Link(s) to work / Resources: ###

As you can see we went with a school whiteboard style app.

## Day 31 ##
17th April 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* We started off the morning with the usual pair feedback and codewars
* Today we had a guest speaker in from Bravissimo talking about UX 
* WE continued with react and covered;
  - Smart (stateful) Vs Dumb (stateless) components
  - Component trees and how to create them
  - Pure functions: a pure function is a function that always returns the same output given the same input, and doesn't modify any variables outside its own scope.
  - Side effects in react: In React, a side effect refers to any change that a component makes to its environment outside of rendering. This can include things like modifying the DOM, making HTTP requests, setting timeouts or intervals, or interacting with external APIs. While side effects are sometimes necessary for a component to function properly, they can also introduce bugs and make the code harder to understand and maintain.
  - `useEffect`: In React, useEffect is a hook that lets you perform side effects like data fetching or DOM updates after a component renders, but only when certain conditions are met. This can be a simpler way to manage side effects in your code, without needing to use complex class components or fiddly lifecycle methods.

### Thoughts: ###
Can't go wrong with more react to wash down the previous weeks overwhelming amount :rofl:. Everyone on the bootcamp seems to be struggling at least a little so I dont feel too bad.
