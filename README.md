## Day 1 ##
7th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* Had a cold shower (Yes, its relevant :laughing:)
* Created this repo for the challenge.
* Learned how to use markup to format my README page. 
* Created a new README page for my main profile with my fresh skills!
### Thoughts ###
~~Dayumm that water was COLDDDDD!! :cold_face:~~

I did get a little nervous about starting a challenge right before the bootcamp (which happens to be touted as the hardest thing well ever do!) but I then realised it's complimentary to the camp and it's only 1 hour a day. Now I've got stuck in and I'm already enjoying it!

## Day 2 ##
8th March 2023
### Today's Progress: ###
* I decided to try out some javascript (complete noob!) and follow along with some javascript app building tutorials. First step was building a colour flipper app using html, css & javascript.
* Started using VS code and downloaded 'Live preview' extension to see what I was building.

## Thoughts: ##
I think I may have jumped the gun on this one! :sweat_smile: Perhaps I should have tried to learn some basic Javascript before attemtping to build an app with it? I was able to follow along with the tutorial around 60-70% and then explored the creators github to help me finish it off. I did enjoy starting to use VS code and I'm already starting to build a better picture of how everything works together.

Note to self: LEARN JAVASCRIPT!
